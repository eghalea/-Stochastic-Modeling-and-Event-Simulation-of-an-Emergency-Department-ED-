# -Stochastic-Modeling-and-Discrete-Event-Simulation-of-an-Emergency-Department-ED-
This project demostrates an attempt to model an ED system by replicating multiple scenarios that will aid the optimization of the ED services through efficient resource utilization to solve overcrowding problem and reduce average waiting and service time in the ED
